# Face Detection Library Research Findings

## Overview
This document summarizes the research findings on face detection libraries for our attendance system. The goal is to select the most appropriate library for implementing a face detection attendance system for 200 employees.

## Libraries Evaluated

### 1. face_recognition
- **Built on**: dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition with deep learning
- **Accuracy**: 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark
- **Features**:
  - Simple Python API
  - Command-line tools for face recognition and detection
  - Can find face locations in an image
  - Can identify facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, chin)
  - Can recognize who appears in each photo
  - Supports real-time face recognition
- **Installation**: Requires dlib with Python bindings
- **Pros**:
  - High accuracy
  - Simple API
  - Well-documented
  - Both Python library and command-line tools
- **Cons**:
  - Requires dlib which can be challenging to install
  - May have performance limitations for real-time processing

### 2. OpenCV
- **Features**:
  - Multiple face detection algorithms (Haar Cascades, DNN-based)
  - Integrated with many other computer vision capabilities
  - Cross-platform
- **Pros**:
  - Widely used and supported
  - Fast processing (especially Haar Cascades)
  - Extensive documentation
- **Cons**:
  - Haar Cascades have lower accuracy compared to deep learning methods
  - Requires additional code for face recognition

### 3. Deep Learning-based Face Detectors
Based on the LearnOpenCV comparison:

| Model | Accuracy (AP@0.5) | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| RetinaFace | 0.994 | Highest accuracy |
| YuNet | 0.994 | High accuracy, good performance |
| Dual Shot Face Detector | 0.989 | Very good accuracy |
| SSD | 0.931 | Good accuracy |
| MTCNN | 0.915 | Good accuracy |
| MediaPipe | 0.743 | Lower accuracy but good for real-time |

## Performance Considerations
- **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Deep learning models like RetinaFace and YuNet offer the highest accuracy but may require more computational resources
- **Real-time Processing**: For attendance systems, we need a balance between accuracy and speed
- **Hardware Requirements**: Consider the deployment environment and available hardware

## Recommendation
For our attendance system, we recommend using the **face_recognition** library for the following reasons:
1. High accuracy (99.38%)
2. Simple API that makes implementation straightforward
3. Built-in face recognition capabilities (not just detection)
4. Good documentation and community support
5. Suitable for the scale of 200 employees

As an alternative, we could consider using **YuNet** through OpenCV if we need better performance while maintaining high accuracy.

## Next Steps
1. Design system architecture based on the selected library
2. Evaluate database options for storing employee records and attendance data
3. Research web frameworks for the frontend interface
