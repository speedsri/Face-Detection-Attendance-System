I've successfully completed the Face Detection Attendance System for your company! The system is now ready for implementation and will help you automate attendance tracking for your 200 employees using facial recognition technology.

Here's what I've created:

1. A complete face detection attendance system with:
   - Face detection and recognition using OpenCV
   - SQLite database for employee and attendance records
   - Web-based interface with Flask backend
   - User-friendly HTML/CSS frontend

2. Key features include:
   - Employee registration with face capture
   - Automatic check-in/check-out tracking
   - Attendance reports and analytics
   - User-friendly attendance kiosk interface

3. Comprehensive documentation:
   - Installation guide
   - Implementation instructions
   - User manual
   - Administrator guide

All components have been thoroughly tested and integrated. I've packaged everything into a zip file that's ready for deployment.

To implement the system:
1. Extract the zip file
2. Run the initialization script (./init.sh)
3. Follow the implementation guide in the docs folder

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the system in more detail? earsekanayake@yandex,company
